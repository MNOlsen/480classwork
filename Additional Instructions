Additional Instructions to be Implemented for Project:
1) XOR R[REG], ADDRESS
2) READ R[REG], ADDRESS
3) WRITE R[REG], ADDRESS
4) DEC R[REG], ADDRESS (R[REG] = R[REG] - 1)
5) NAND R[REG], ADDRESS
6) NOR R[REG], ADDRESS
7) SRA R[REG] --> arithmetic shift
8) SLA R[REG] --> arithmetic shift
9) SW  R[REG], ADDRESS --> store address in register
10)LW  R[REG], ADDRESS --> load from address to register
11)SLT R[REG], ADDRESS
12)ORI R[REG], ADDRESS
13)ANDI R[REG], ADDRESS
14)LI R[REG], ADDRESS --Load immediate address
15)XORI R[REG], ADDRESS
16)CLZ R[REG], ADDRESS --count leading zeros at address , store result in register
